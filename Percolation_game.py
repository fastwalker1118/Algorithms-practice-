#This is a 2 player percolation game where both player are trying to make a path from the top to the bottom by opening blocks
#This game is the application of the classic algorithm Quick union (making a tree through changing the array element that was the same with the index)
#more detailed description about how the game works are in the output

#this function returns the root of i (i stands for the index in the id array)
def root(i):
	while (i != id[i]): # tracks down to the root (as long as the element doesn't equal to it's index, I go the the upper level of the tree until the element is the same with it's index)
		i = id[i]
	return i  

#identical to root function but this one is for player 2
def root2(i) :
	while (i != id_player2[i]):
		i = id_player2[i]
	return i

#this function unions 2 elements on the array by changing the second ones length to the first one
def unionn(p, q): # p and q are the 2 indexs that we want to union
	i = root(p) 
	j = root(q)
